Approach:

Trying hard to improve my speed, so this contest was used as a speedrun contest for me.
Made sure I understood roughly what the protocol does from the contest spec, and then proceeded to open up all the in scope contracts in VSC tabs, and then just go for it line by line, hunting for code that doesnt look right.

Learned:
Learned that assumptions are made too often when developing codebases.
Learned additional useful information about oracles, especially composite oracles.

My aim is to give myself more than 2 hours, preferably couple days for speedruns. This is my first speedrun contest, I will aim to do better next time.

### Time spent:
2 hours
