The approve function in this code snippet is typically used by a token holder to grant permission to another address (spender) to spend a certain amount of their tokens on their behalf. It is not necessary for a user to call this function with their own address as the spender parameter in order to spend their own tokens.

In the given code snippet, if a user calls this approve function with their own address as the spender parameter, it will update the allowances mapping for their own address, effectively granting themselves permission to spend a certain amount of their own tokens. However, this is redundant and unnecessary since the user already has full control over their own tokens.

function approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) external       returns (bool) {
//Check if spender is token owner 
    require(spender != msg.sender, "Self-approval is not    allowed");
    
    uint96 amount;
    if (rawAmount == type(uint).max) {
        amount = type(uint96).max;
    } else {
        amount = safe96(rawAmount, "Well::approve: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    }

    allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;

    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    return true;
}

By adding the `require` statement, the function will check if the spender address is different from the caller's address (msg.sender). If the condition is not met (i.e., if the spender is the same as the caller), the function will throw an exception and the approval will not be granted.
