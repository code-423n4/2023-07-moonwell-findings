### Approach Taken in Evaluating the Codebase:

- Conducted a thorough code review of the Moonwell project's repository on GitHub.
- Analyzed the smart contracts to understand their functionality, security measures, and adherence to best practices.
- Reviewed the usage of libraries and dependencies to assess their reliability and security implications.
- Examined the test suite to evaluate the extent of test coverage and ensure the robustness of the code.

### Findings from Codebase Analysis:

- The Moonwell project implements a decent implementation of lending protocol using smart contracts 
- The codebase demonstrates a well-structured architecture and follows best practices for Solidity development.
- Extensive test coverage is evident in the test suite, which contributes to the reliability of the codebase.

### Lessons Learned from Evaluating the Codebase:

- Understanding the importance of secure smart contract development and utilizing established libraries for safety and reliability.
- Gained insights into implementing a lending protocol, which can be applied to similar projects.
