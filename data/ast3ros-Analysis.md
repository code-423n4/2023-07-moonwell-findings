1. What did you learn from reviewing this codebase? Be specific.
- I gained a deeper understanding of the Compound v2 Protocol and how MoonWell differs from it in its reward distribution mechanism.
- I also learned about UUSP pattern and a common interface can be used to store storage variables. For example in MErc20Storage.sol, it stores the storage variables for the Delegator and Delegate contracts.
- I knew about Wormhole and how to use it to send messages between chains.
2. What approach did you take in evaluating this codebase in order to help you grow your skills and code review resources?
- I read the documents and run through the codebase quickly once to understand it at a high level.
- I review the codebase again line by line and write down the notes and questions.
- I addresses the questions and notes and runs the tests to make sure the codebase is working as expected.
3. How much time did you spend?
- 20 hours
